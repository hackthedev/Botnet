# Botnet Creation Tool - W.I.P.
This is a new project I've launched. In my attempts to always learn something this is what i came up with. My Goal: Make a Application that searches the web for ip addresses, if SSH is available, bruteforce it using wordlist. If the connection was successfully bruteforced, save it.

<br>

Im trying to simulate a way on how botnets are created. Although the way im doing it might be inefficient, it should still work. And since its only for education and testing, I dont care that much about it, although i want to make it as good as possible.
